I worked on this project with great interest because I have experience in React Native. However, I faced difficulty with the authentication part because I attempted social authentication using AWS Cognito, but I do not have an AWS account due to the requirement of providing credit details during account creation. I then tried using Expo Social Auth, but encountered many issues with the Facebook Developer site. Despite this, I was able to complete the rest of the project successfully
